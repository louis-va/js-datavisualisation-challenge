## Description

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

I worked on this project in october 2023 with the goal of improving my understanding of Javascript and more specifically on using libraries, manipulating the DOM and using the fetch API.

It is an exercise which is part of the Becode bootcamp. The goal was to retrieve data from the DOM and reinject it with multiple graphs.


## Built With

* ESLint
* Prettier
